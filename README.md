## Installation 💻

To get started with Hacxk-MD, follow these steps for various server environments:

## First, Obtain a Session 🔐

Visit the [Hacxk-MD Session Provider(NOT AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW!)](https://github.com/hacxk/Hacxk-MD) and scan the QR code or enter the pairing code. Once completed, the session file will be sent to your paired WhatsApp number. Retrieve that session file.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> If you encounter an "Invalid QR Code" message while scanning, simply restart your NodeJS process.
